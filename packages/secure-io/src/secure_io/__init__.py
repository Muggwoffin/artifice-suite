"""Write JSON files with OS-appropriate access controls.

current user can read the file.

- **POSIX**: uses ``os.open(..., 0o600)``, which creates the file with
  restricted permissions atomically — the file is never world-readable.
- **Windows**: creates the file empty, applies an ACL via ``icacls``, verifies
  the ACL (via ``Get-Acl``, for locale-independent SID comparison), and only
  then writes the contents.  The file exists empty and unprotected between
  creation and the ACL call, but no secret is exposed because the file is
  still empty during that window.

``restrict_to_current_user(path)`` applies the same restriction to an
**existing** file, which closes the live-defect window for installations that
already have unprotected files on disk.
