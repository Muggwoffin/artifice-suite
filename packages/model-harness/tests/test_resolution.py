"""Tests for :mod:`model_harness.resolution`.

The resolver's one job is to turn "what is installed" plus "what do we need"
into a single model name — and to refuse to substitute a different model for
one the user explicitly chose.  These tests pin the precedence order and the
two cases that must never silently degrade: a missing user choice and a vision
role with no certified vision model installed.
