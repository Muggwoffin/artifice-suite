"""Shared BYOM connector contract for the Artifice Suite.

`CLAUDE.md` requires that every model interaction pass through structured
schemas in this package. Until 2026-07-29 this module was 29 lines defining a
config object and a ``SchemaT`` TypeVar that nothing used — the "schema-validated
call shape" its docstring promised did not exist, and all four apps carried
their own client.

:mod:`model_harness.contract` now defines that call shape. Transport is still
per-app; adapters implement :class:`~model_harness.contract.ModelProvider`.
Porting is tracked as Phase 3 in ``IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md``.
