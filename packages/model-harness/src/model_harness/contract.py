"""The BYOM call contract for the Artifice Suite.

This module defines *what a model call is* in this project. It contains no
transport: no HTTP client, no provider SDK, no ``openai`` import. A provider
adapter implements :class:`ModelProvider` and lives beside the code that owns
the connection; the rules about what may be asked, what may be returned, and
what happens when a provider cannot comply all live here, once.

The design answers three questions, in order of how much trouble each has
caused in this codebase:

1. **What does a structured call look like?**  Every call declares a Pydantic
   schema for its response. ``schema`` is a required argument, not an optional
   one — that is the whole mechanism by which "no freeform chat" is structural
   rather than aspirational. Code that wants prose declares a schema with one
   string field, which forces it to name what it is asking for.

2. **How does a provider say it cannot do that?**  It returns a
   :class:`ProviderCapabilities` naming the best
   :class:`StructuredOutputMode` it supports. A local Ollama build and a
   hosted endpoint have genuinely different abilities here and the suite is
   BYOM, so the contract cannot assume the strongest one.

3. **What happens when it cannot?**  The harness degrades down a fixed ladder
   and **records which rung it used** on every result. If it reaches the bottom
   it raises :class:`StructuredOutputUnsupported`. It never silently returns
   prose to a caller that asked for a schema.

That third point is the one worth defending. The suite carried **five** separate
"recover JSON from whatever the model said" helpers when this was written — not
the three first recorded — and none of them could tell a caller whether it
received a guaranteed-schema response or a lucky parse. Those two things have
very different reliability and the code treated them identically.
:attr:`HarnessResult.mode_used` and :attr:`HarnessResult.repaired` exist so that
distinction survives the call.

Three are now gone: both of ``artifice-graph``'s when its extraction path was
ported, and ``parse_json_robust`` in ``artifice-transcribe``, which turned out to
have no callers at all. **Two remain, both in ``artifice-draft``** —
``parse_llm_json_response`` and ``_parse_llm_response`` — and retiring them is
the acceptance criterion for this phase.

``driver._extract_json`` is not a sixth. It runs only on the ``PROMPTED`` rung and
its result carries ``mode_used=PROMPTED``, so a caller can tell a scrape from a
guarantee. Do not delete it to satisfy the criterion above.
