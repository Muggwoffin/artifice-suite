"""OpenAI-compatible HTTP adapter implementing the :class:`ModelProvider` contract.

This adapter speaks the OpenAI chat-completions protocol and can drive Ollama,
LM Studio, OpenAI, and any other backend that exposes a ``/v1/chat/completions``
endpoint.  It does not import any provider SDK — the transport is plain
``httpx``, which three of the four apps already depend on.

``capabilities()`` returns static knowledge, never probes the server.  The
reasoning is documented on :meth:`OpenAIProvider.capabilities`.

# -- Static capability knowledge -----------------------------------------------

# Because ``capabilities()`` must not do I/O, capability is derived from the
# provider type and model name alone.  The table below is deliberately
# conservative: it under-declares for generic-api rather than over-claiming for
# a backend whose exact version we cannot know.

# Ollama supports ``response_format: { type: "json_object" }`` as of 0.2.x.
# Structured outputs (``json_schema``) arrived in 0.5.x but not every
# installation is current.  Claiming JSON_OBJECT is safe — the ladder will
# discover NATIVE_SCHEMA support organically when an app overrides.
#
# LM Studio 0.3.x supports ``json_object``.  Structured outputs are documented
# as experimental on some builds, so we keep the same stance.
#
# "generic-api" is the catch-all for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.  We default
# to PROMPTED because the adapter cannot know what the server supports, and the
# contract explicitly prefers a conservative underestimate to a confusing
# validation failure at call time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    provider_type:
        Which provider class this adapter represents.  Determines the default
        capability returned by :meth:`capabilities`.
    endpoint_policy:
        An object satisfying the :class:`EndpointPolicy` Protocol.  The adapter
        resolves every endpoint through this before making a request.  Pass a
        stub for testing.
    http_client:
        An ``httpx.AsyncClient`` instance.  The adapter does not own it — the
        caller manages its lifetime and can share it across calls.
    default_capability:
        Override the default capability for this adapter.  Takes precedence
        over the static lookup table for *this* adapter only.  Useful when the
        deployer knows the exact server version.
    model_capabilities:
        Per-model capability overrides, keyed by model name.  Merged on top of
        any static overrides.
