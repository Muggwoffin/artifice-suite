"""Model-server discovery — probing endpoints for capability and liveness.

This module is where the I/O lives.  :mod:`model_harness.registry` holds the
known-endpoint data; this module consumes it to ask "is there a model server at
this URL, and what does it offer?"

Every probe passes through :meth:`EndpointPolicy.validate_url` before any
network call.  The policy raises :class:`~model_harness.contract.EndpointRejected`
on failure; nothing in this module catches it — callers that sit behind an HTTP
layer wrap it in their own exception type.

The diagnostic hints preserved here exist because real users hit them.  Each
fires on its own error condition, never by substring-matching a port number in
a URL.
