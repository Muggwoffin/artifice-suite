"""Endpoint allowlist policy — which addresses this suite may send a model request to.

This module is the single owner of the rule. Every app that validates a model
endpoint must call through here rather than carrying its own copy.

The policy exists because "local-first" is a positive guarantee — the software
states what it permits rather than defaulting open and hoping the admin locked
it down. It lives in ``model-harness`` rather than in each app so a working
setup does not break differently in each app.

    This is deliberately NOT loopback-only.  Academics on a university network
    reach centrally-served models from a personal machine, so a private-network
    address is a first-class case rather than an escape hatch.  "Local-first"
    means the software never *requires* a remote service, not that it refuses
    one the user chose.

    What is still enforced:

    * the scheme must be ``http`` or ``https``
    * link-local addresses are refused outright, which is what keeps cloud
      metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254) out of reach
    * public addresses require an explicit opt-in, so a mistyped or injected
      hostname cannot quietly send prompts to the open internet

    Hostnames are resolved and *every* returned address is checked, because a
    name that resolves to one permitted and one public address is not permitted.
    Resolution here and connection later is a time-of-check gap; closing it
    needs the connection pinned to the validated address, which belongs in the
    provider adapter rather than in this policy.  Recorded, not solved.
