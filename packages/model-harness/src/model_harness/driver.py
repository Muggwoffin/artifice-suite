"""The driver that apps call to execute a structured model request.

This module owns the degradation ladder: it takes a :class:`StructuredRequest`,
selects the strongest mode the provider supports, calls :meth:`ModelProvider.complete`,
validates the response, and degrades one rung on validation failure.  No app
should replicate this logic — it is the single point where the contract's
guarantees are enforced.

    """Execute a structured model request with degradation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    request:
        The fully-specified request.  Its ``mode`` field is treated as the
        caller's minimum guarantee — the driver will use a stronger mode if
        the provider supports one, but never a weaker one.
    provider:
        Any :class:`ModelProvider` adapter.
    schema_model:
        The Pydantic model to validate the response against.
    endpoint_policy:
        If provided, the endpoint in ``request.config`` is validated through
        this policy before any network call.  Rejection raises
        :class:`~model_harness.contract.EndpointRejected`.
    minimum:
        Override the caller's minimum mode.  When ``None`` (the default),
        ``request.mode`` is used.  Allows a caller to set a stricter floor
        without reconstructing the request.

    Returns
    -------
    HarnessResult
        The validated response, with ``mode_used`` set to the rung of the
        ladder that actually produced a valid response, and ``repaired``
        indicating whether degradation occurred.

    Raises
    ------
    StructuredOutputUnsupported
        If no rung of the ladder can produce a valid response — including
        when the provider's best capability is weaker than the caller's
        minimum, or when validation fails at the bottom rung.
    SchemaValidationFailed
        If the response was unparseable as JSON.  Schema-mismatch failures
        are handled by degradation, not by raising.
