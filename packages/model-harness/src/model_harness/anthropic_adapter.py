"""Anthropic HTTP adapter implementing the :class:`ModelProvider` contract.

This adapter speaks the Anthropic Messages API and can drive any model
accessible through it.  It does not import the Anthropic SDK — the transport
is plain ``httpx``, which the harness already depends on.

``capabilities()`` returns static knowledge, never probes the server.  The
reasoning is documented on :meth:`AnthropicProvider.capabilities`.

**Structured-output gap.**  The Anthropic API supports tool-use (which this
adapter uses for ``NATIVE_SCHEMA``) but has no ``json_object`` equivalent.
:class:`ProviderCapabilities.supported_modes` declares this gap explicitly,
and the degradation ladder skips ``JSON_OBJECT`` rather than asking this
adapter for a mode it cannot implement.  See the contract module-level docs
and the ``ProviderCapabilities`` docstring.

class AnthropicProvider:
    """An :class:`ModelProvider` backed by the Anthropic Messages API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endpoint_policy:
        An object satisfying the :class:`EndpointPolicy` Protocol.  The
        adapter resolves every endpoint through this before making a request.
        Pass a stub for testing.
    http_client:
        An ``httpx.AsyncClient`` instance.  The adapter does not own it — the
        caller manages its lifetime and can share it across calls.
    default_capability:
        Override the default capability for this adapter.  The
        ``supported_modes`` of this override replaces the default gap-aware
        set — pass ``frozenset({NATIVE_SCHEMA, JSON_OBJECT, PROMPTED})`` only
        if you are certain the backend implements ``json_object``.
    model_capabilities:
        Per-model capability overrides, keyed by model name.  Merged on top
        of any static overrides.
    max_tokens:
        Maximum tokens in the response.  **Required** by the Anthropic API;
        defaults to 4096.
