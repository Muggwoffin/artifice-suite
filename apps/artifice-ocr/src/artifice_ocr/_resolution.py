"""Once-per-run model/backend resolution for artifice-ocr.

The config now ships empty model names and ``"auto"`` backends (see
:mod:`artifice_ocr.config`).  Those two defaults are *inputs to a decision*,
not a usable endpoint: an empty model name is "no explicit choice" and
``"auto"`` is "whichever local server is reachable and can serve a suitable
model".  This module is the one place that turns those into a concrete
``(model, backend)`` pair.

It performs the I/O — probing the configured Ollama / LM Studio URLs with
:func:`model_harness.discovery.probe_endpoint_sync` and consulting
:func:`model_harness.resolution.resolve_model` — exactly once per run, then
caches the answer.  The stages read the cache through :func:`model_for` /
:func:`backend_for`; they never probe, and :func:`artifice_ocr.config.get`
stays a pure settings accessor.

Resolution precedence is delegated to ``resolve_model``; the only policy this
module adds is *which endpoint to ask* and *how to fail*:

* an explicit backend (``ollama`` / ``lm_studio``) probes only that endpoint;
* ``auto`` probes both configured local endpoints and picks the one that
  serves the resolved model;
* a missing *user choice* (``configured_but_missing``) and an empty shelf
  (``NONE_AVAILABLE``) each raise a :class:`RuntimeError` naming the role, the
  endpoint probed, and what to do — never a raw provider 404.
