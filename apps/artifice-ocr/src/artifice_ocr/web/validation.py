    Backslashes are normalised to forward slashes (same rationale as

    ``must_exist=False`` resolves non-strictly, so a path that is inside
    *container* but absent is returned rather than refused. A caller wanting to
    answer 404 for a missing file needs this: with strict resolution the
    nonexistent path raises first and every miss becomes a 400, which collapses
    "not there" and "not permitted" into one answer.

    **Containment is still decided after resolution either way**, so relaxing
    existence does not relax the security check — and it must not be reordered
    to test existence first. An endpoint that answered 404 for a path outside
    *container* would become an existence oracle for arbitrary filesystem
