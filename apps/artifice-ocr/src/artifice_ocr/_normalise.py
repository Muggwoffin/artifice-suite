"""Deterministic OCR artifact repair — pre-pass for the cleanup stage.

This module handles four of the five repairs the cleanup prompt previously
delegated to a language model, applying them with exact regex rules that
cannot alter proper nouns, dates, numbers, reference codes, or transliterated
umlauts the way a model can.

Rules (in application order):
    1. Keep hyphens after known prefixes (self-, well-, co-, …).
    2. Rejoin words hyphenated across a line break.
    3. Join em-dashes that break across a line end.
    4. Join line breaks that fall mid-sentence.
    5. Collapse doubled spaces and remove space before punctuation.

Rule 2 applies a two-case heuristic for German:
    - Lowercase continuation after the break → the hyphen was a soft
      line-break artifact; remove it and join the word.
    - Uppercase continuation → the hyphen is a real compound hyphen
      (e.g. "Kaiser-\\nWilhelm"); keep the hyphen, only strip the line
      break.

Rule 1 catches the exception: some English prefixes ("self-", "well-",
"co-", …) keep their hyphen even when the following word is lowercase.
"self-\\nevident" → "self-evident", not "selfevident".  The list is
explicit and dependency-free.

Only letter-shape misreadings (rn→m, u→n, l→1, 0→O) remain for the model
— that genuinely requires context to disambiguate.

# Sentence-ending punctuation (``. ! ?``) is excluded: a line ending with a
# full stop, exclamation or question mark is a genuine sentence boundary.

# The replace preserves the end-of-line character and inserts a single space,
# stripping any leading/trailing horizontal whitespace around the break.
