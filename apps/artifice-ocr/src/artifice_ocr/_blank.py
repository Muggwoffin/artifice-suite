"""Near-blank page detection.

olmOCR 2 (arXiv:2510.19817 s4, "Handle blank pages"): a model never trained
on blank pages hallucinates plausible-looking filler instead of recognising
there is nothing to transcribe. Cheapest fix: never send it one. A blank or
near-blank page (a verso, an inserted flyleaf) has near-zero greyscale
variance regardless of exposure — unlike text detection, this needs no
model and is safe to run unconditionally, independent of the opt-in
``preprocess_enabled`` pipeline.

    typescript or handwriting of any density sits well over 20. 6.0 leaves a
